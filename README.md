# Tauri with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Make sure to install the [Tauri dependencies](https://tauri.studio/docs/get-started/intro) on your system (I'm using WSL2/Ubuntu).

`npx create-react-app tauri-cra-example`

Added `tauri` to project as dev dep

`yarn add @tauri-apps/cli@latest -D`

`yarn tauri init`
